**Manual Changes and Updating Context**
- I occasionally made manual edits to files without updating Context afterward. Because Context assumes that the current file state matches its last known output, this created desynchronization issues. Some of its bug fixes failed simply because it was unaware of my local changes. If Context could automatically read updated TypeScript files into its working state, it would prevent this problem. This experience taught me how vital shared context and consistent synchronization are when working with agentic coding systems.

**Leveraging Multiple AI Tools**
- A major takeaway was learning how to combine tools based on their strengths. I used v0 to generate layout inspiration and initial structures for pages. This taught me that success with AI-assisted development is not about using one tool for everything, but rather about orchestrating specialized tools to work together effectively.

**Working on a Team**
- It was good experience to work on a software project with a team. I learned lots of good practices that I will carry with me: reducing scope, user testing, effective communication, time management.
