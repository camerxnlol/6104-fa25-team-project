# User Journey
## User Journey 1

**Problem:**  
People often struggle to connect with others from different countries due to cultural differences or limited exposure. Even though music is universal, most platforms focus on personalized algorithms rather than helping users explore global cultures. Users need an engaging, easy way to discover music from around the world and build cultural understanding.

**Context:**  
A user wants to discover music from other countries—either out of curiosity, travel interest, or a desire to better understand cultures different from their own. The app provides a globe-based interface where users can choose a country and explore both AI-curated and community-curated music recommendations, focusing on local, emerging artists.

**Goal:**  
The user wants to explore local music of different countries easily.

**Specific Actions**  
**Action 1: User logs in**  
User is brought to the Home Globe Interface.
They see an interactive 3D globe they can zoom, spin, and click on.

**Action 2: User selects a country on the globe**  
User zooms in and clicks on Vietnam.
User is brought to the recommendations page displaying 3 system-recommended songs from local Vietnamese artists, and 3 community-recommended songs (if exists).

**Action 3: User opens a song and listens**  
The YouTube player opens inline and the song begins playing.
The app automatically add the song to the user’s Passport

**Action 4: User goes to Passport the next day to find the song they listened to previously**  
User sees a globe interface with visited (listened to music from) countries highlighted

**Action 5: User wants to find the song they listened to yesterday in Vietnam and selects Vietnam on the globe**  
User is brought to the history page for Vietnam and sees the song from yesterday

**Outcome:**  
The user discovered a new local song from another country, listened to it in-app, and revisited it later through their Passport. This helped the user get a small glimpse into Vietnamese music and sparked curiosity about the culture.


## User Journey 2

**Problem:**   
User wants to share their favorite songs from a country they’ve discovered. They want to contribute to the community playlist so others can find new music.

**Context:**  
User has used SongBridge for a while and explored a lot of new, international music through the app. Recently, their local friend in a different country recommended to them a song they really like. User would like to submit this song to the community recommendation. 

**Goal:**  
The user wants to add a song recommendation to the community and receive confirmation that it was successfully submitted.

**Specific actions:**  

**Action 1: User logs in**  
User is greeted with the interactive globe interface.

**Action 2: User clicks on the country they want to add a recommendation for.**  
User is brought to the recommendations page for that country.
User sees existing recommendations along with an “Add Recommendation” button.

**Action 3: User clicks add recommendation**  
User inputs the song name, artist, URL, language, and (optionally) genre.

**Action 4: User submits the recommendation**  
A confirmation pop-up appears: “Thank you for your suggestion.”

**Outcome:**  
User successfully contributed a song to the community playlist. They helped expand the collective recommendations for that country and can return later to explore other user submissions.
