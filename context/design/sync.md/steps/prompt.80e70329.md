# prompt: Create syncs for the routes that are specified by the passthroughs file as being "excluded". You should refer to the concept background and sync background for instructions on how to construct syncs in this manner. DO NOT create any syncs involving LikertSurvey routes, but refer to the sample sync file to see that you need a request and response for each sync. You should note that these excluded routes require things like the user being logged in (i.e. they can only upload something if they are authenticated and have a valid session). You should write syncs accordingly. Use the concepts file for imports.
