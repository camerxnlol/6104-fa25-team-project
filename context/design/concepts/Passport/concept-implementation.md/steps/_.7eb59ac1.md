# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

## Passport

### concept: Passport \[User, Song]

* **purpose**: track a user's musical exploration across different countries to
  encourage broader cultural discovery
* **principle**: if a user listens to a song from a country they haven't
  explored before, then that country is added to their passport, which they can
  view as a list of explored countries
* **state**:
  * a set of HistoryEntries with
    * a user User
    * a song Song
    * a country String
    * a date Date
* **actions**:
  * `logExploration (user: User, song: Song, country: String): (entry: HistoryEntry)`
    * **requires**: true
    * **effects**: creates a new HistoryEntry `e` with the given `user`, `song`,
      and `country`, sets its `date` to the current time, and returns the ID of
      `e` as `entry`
* **queries**:
  * `_getExploredCountries (user: User): (country: String)`
    * **requires**: user has one or more HistoryEntries
    * **effects**: returns the set of unique countries from all HistoryEntries
      associated with the given user
  * `_getHistoryForCountry (user: User, country: String): (entry: {song: Song, date: Date})`
    * **requires**: user has one or more HistoryEntries for the given country
    * **effects**: returns all song and date pairs from HistoryEntries
      associated with the given user and country, ordered by most recent date
      first

### Notes

**Q:** Why do we not just have User as the outer object of this concept?

**A:**

* **Separation of Concerns:** The `Passport` concept's sole purpose is to "track
  a user's musical exploration." Its state should therefore represent that
  exploration history as directly as possible. The primary "thing" in this
  concept is a `HistoryEntry`. A `User` is simply an attribute *of* that entry,
  indicating who performed the action.
* **Concept Independence:** If we were to nest the history *inside* a `User`
  document, it would imply that the `Passport` concept is responsible for
  managing or modifying the `User` object. A different concept, like
  `UserAuthentication` or `UserProfile`, should be the sole owner of the `User`
  entity. By keeping the history as a separate collection of `HistoryEntry`
  documents that simply *reference* a `User`, we maintain a clean separation.
  The `Passport` concept doesn't need to know anything about a `User` other than
  its ID.
