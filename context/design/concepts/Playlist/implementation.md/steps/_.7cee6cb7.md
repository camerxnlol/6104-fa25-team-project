# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

## Playlist

**concept** AIPrioritizedTask \[User, Song]

* **purpose**: organize collections of songs for personal use or sharing
* **principle**: If a user creates a playlist, names it "Road Trip Jams", and
  adds several songs, they can later retrieve that specific list of songs. If
  they then remove a song, reorder the remaining songs, and rename the playlist
  to "Classic Rock", the playlist will reflect all of these changes.
* **state**:
  * a set of Playlists with
    * owner: User
    * name: String
    * songs: sequence of Song
* **actions**:
  * `createPlaylist (owner: User, name: String): (playlist: Playlist)`
    * **requires**: `name` is not an empty string; the `owner` does not already
      have a playlist with that `name`
    * **effects**: creates a new `Playlist` `p`; sets `owner` of `p` to `owner`;
      sets `name` of `p` to `name`; sets `songs` of `p` to an empty sequence;
      returns `p` as `playlist`
  * `deletePlaylist (playlist: Playlist, user: User)`
    * **requires**: a `Playlist` with id `playlist` exists; the `owner` of
      `playlist` is `user`
    * **effects**: deletes the `Playlist` `playlist`
  * `renamePlaylist (playlist: Playlist, newName: String, user: User)`
    * **requires**: a `Playlist` with id `playlist` exists; the `owner` of
      `playlist` is `user`; `newName` is not an empty string; the `user` does
      not already have another playlist with `newName`
    * **effects**: updates the `name` of `playlist` to `newName`
  * `addSong (playlist: Playlist, song: Song, user: User)`
    * **requires**: a `Playlist` with id `playlist` exists; the `owner` of
      `playlist` is `user`
    * **effects**: appends `song` to the `songs` sequence of `playlist`
  * `removeSong (playlist: Playlist, song: Song, user: User)`
    * **requires**: a `Playlist` with id `playlist` exists; the `owner` of
      `playlist` is `user`; `song` exists in the `songs` sequence of `playlist`
    * **effects**: removes all occurrences of `song` from the `songs` sequence
      of `playlist`
  * `reorderSongs (playlist: Playlist, songs: sequence of Song, user: User)`
    * **requires**: a `Playlist` with id `playlist` exists; the `owner` of
      `playlist` is `user`; the multiset of `songs` in the new sequence is
      identical to the multiset of songs currently in the playlist
    * **effects**: updates the `songs` sequence of `playlist` to be the new
      `songs` sequence
* **queries**:
  * `_getPlaylistsForUser (user: User): (playlist: Playlist, name: String)`
    * **requires**: true
    * **effects**: returns a set of records, each containing the id and name of
      a playlist owned by `user`
  * `_getPlaylist (playlist: Playlist): (playlist: { _id: Playlist, name: String, owner: User, songs: sequence of Song })`
    * **requires**: `playlist` exists
    * **effects**: returns all information for the given `playlist`
