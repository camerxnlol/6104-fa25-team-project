## **Issues**
- **Work division:**  
  We need to determine whether tasks should be split into frontend and backend roles, or if everyone should work on a bit of everything.

## **Plans & Decisions**
- For **Checkpoint Alpha**, the goal is to have:
  - A **complete backend**  
  - A **barebones frontend**
- During **Checkpoint Beta**, we will:
  - Implement our visual design choices  
  - Improve the frontend experience  
- **Rationale:**
