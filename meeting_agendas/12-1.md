## **Agenda**
- Progress update  
- Plans and decisions  
- Questions  

---

## **Progress Report**
- Reviewed how last week went and alignment to the development plan.  
- Since the last meeting, the **entire backend** has been completed (concepts, syncs, etc.).  
- For the **Alpha deadline**, the frontend framework was completed.  
- Most of the app’s functionality was **not yet implemented** in the frontend.

---

## **Design Changes**
- **No design changes** were made since the previous meeting.

---

## **Issues**
- **Inconsistent naming conventions:**  
  Variance in variable, parameter, and argument naming across the codebase (e.g., `country` vs. `countryName`).

---

## **Plans & Decisions**
- Complete **all remaining frontend features**.  
- A fully polished UI is **not required** for the Beta submission.  
- UI improvements will be made **after Beta**, once all functionality is in place.

---

## **Questions**
- Clarification needed: The **Beta deadline tomorrow** is *not* the final version of the app.  
  - What additional components or refinements are required for the **final submission** that are not needed for Beta?
